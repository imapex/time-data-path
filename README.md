### Cachet
We'll use [Cachet](https://cachethq.io/ "Title") to provide a pretty status page presentation layer.
### Figuring what we can pull out of systems (data structure, etc)
Primary data source will be APIC-EM to pull data from supported systems
Alternative data source will be pulling from the device directly via a fallback mechanism, if the device doesn't support detailed data polling from APIC-EM.
### Marathon / Mantl
Containers to support Cachet include Nginx, Postgres, and Cachet. These will be maintained within Marathon/Mantl.
